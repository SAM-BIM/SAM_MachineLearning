**SAM_MachineLearning** is part of the **SAM (Sustainable Analytical Model) Toolkit** —  
an open-source collection of tools designed to help engineers create, manage,
and process analytical building models for energy and environmental analysis.

This repository is dedicated to **experimental work and prototyping involving machine learning**
within the SAM ecosystem.
It provides a sandbox for exploring data-driven methods, learning-based models,
and hybrid analytical–machine-learning workflows applied to building performance analysis.

The content of this repository may evolve rapidly and is intended primarily
for research, experimentation, and proof-of-concept development.

## Scope

Typical areas of investigation include:
- application of machine learning to SAM analytical data
- surrogate and reduced-order models
- pattern recognition and clustering in simulation results
- hybrid workflows combining physics-based models and ML approaches

The repository does not represent a stable API and may change as experiments progress.
